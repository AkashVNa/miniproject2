# miniproject2
This project replicates basic functions of a bank.
Four operations are handled in this program which are withdrawal, deposit, balance enquiry and mini statement comprising of previous 5 transactions.
The operations are designed in such a way that it requires a specific input at a specific stage for termination of the program and until that stage and input is reached, the program prompts for inputs recursively.
